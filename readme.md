An Introduction to Chromatic-Solfege
===========================================

Chromatic-Solfege is a variant of Solfege. While Solfege is based on a diatonic
scale, Chromatic-Solfege is based on the twelve-note chromatic scale. This is
a very powerful tool for improving your skill of improvisation especially in 
Jazz.

Following pictures are a summary of the note names of Chromatic-Solfege.

| Ascending Chromatic Scale | Descending Chromatic Scale |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| ![do di re ri mi fa fi sol si la li ti do][aug-small] | ![do ti te la le sol se fa mi me re ra do][dim-small] |

Since the name system of Solfege is based on the diatonic scale, half tones are 
usually named with a modifier such as a sharp a flat as *C♯* or *D♭*.  In 
Chromatic-Solfege, every tone in the Chromatic-Solfege are distinctively named 
as *do di re ri me mi fa ...*; the modifiers are not necessary anymore.

In order to get accustomed to these note names, you may need some routines of 
comprehensive exercise; therefore I have made a series of exercises. I have 
written a paper about the exercises with music sheets, audio data and videos.

At a time to write the paper, I had some difficulty to write words and music at 
a same time. I also had some difficulty to write a large amount of musical 
notes which should be permutated many times. Therefore, I have also written 
some computer programs to transpose a series of notes and read them aloud and 
sing them too.
