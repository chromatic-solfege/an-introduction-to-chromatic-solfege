An Introduction to Chromatic-Solfege
====================================

Chromatic Solfege is a variant of Solfege. While Solfege is base on a diatonic
scale, Chromatic Solfege is based on the twelve-note chromatic scale. This is
( at least for me ) great for improving your skill of improvisation especially 
in Jazz.

Chromatic-Solfege is an extension of traditional Solfege system. As Solfege is 
generally known as *"do re mi"*, Solfege is using name system
which is based on the diatonic scale. On the other hand, Chromatic-Solfege is
based on the twelve-tone chromatic scale. That is, every tone in the 
Chromatic-Solfege are independently named as *"do di re ri me mi fa ..."*.
