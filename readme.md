An Introduction to Chromatic-Solfege
===========================================

Chromatic-Solfege is a variant of Solfege. While Solfege is based on a diatonic
scale, Chromatic-Solfege is based on the twelve-note chromatic scale. This is
a very powerful tool for improving your skill of improvisation especially in 
Jazz.  Following pictures are a summary of the note names of Chromatic-Solfege.

| Ascending Chromatic Scale | Descending Chromatic Scale |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| ![do di re ri mi fa fi sol si la li ti do][aug-small] | ![do ti te la le sol se fa mi me re ra do][dim-small] |

## The Comprehensive Exercise Patterns of Chromatic-Solfege
Since the name system of Solfege is based on the diatonic scale, half tones are 
usually named with a modifier such as a sharp a flat as *C♯* or *D♭*.  In 
Chromatic-Solfege, every tone in the Chromatic-Solfege are distinctively named 
as *do di re ri me mi fa ...*; the modifiers are not necessary anymore.

In order to get accustomed to these note names, you may need some routines of 
comprehensive exercise; therefore, I have made a series of exercises. I have 
written an article about the exercises with music scores, audio data and 
videos.  The article is called [An Introduction to Chromatic-Solfege(pdf)][pdf].

## The Extended Chromatic-Solfege and its Exercise Patterns
I have extended the note naming rule of Chromatic-Solfege into a new form which 
I believe is more suitable to improve your ability of improvising. The 
extension covers modifying the naming rule for double, triple and quadruple 
accidentals. Those irregular accidentals are useful to analyzing pieces of 
polymodal music. The [article][pdf] also explains about the extension.

This Extended Chromatic-Solfege have backward-compatibility with the general 
Chromatic-Solfege; hence, it is not a modified Chromatic-Solfege but extended 
Chromatic-Solfege.
